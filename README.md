# Mini Project Folder
This folder contains a collection of mini projects that I have created as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on a specific topic or technology and is designed to showcase my understanding of that topic or technology.

Each project is organized into its own subdirectory and includes all the necessary files. The README file in each subdirectory provides a brief overview of the project, including its purpose and their screenshorts.

I created these mini projects to practice my programming skills and to gain hands-on experience in a variety of areas, including web development. I hope that these projects will serve as a testament to my abilities and demonstrate my passion for learning and growing as a developer.

Feel free to explore each project and provide feedback or suggestions on how I can improve. Thank you for taking the time to check out my work!
